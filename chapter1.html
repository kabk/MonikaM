                <p> <b> 1. Perception of culture and language according to semiotics</b> <br><br>  

<b>1.1 Culture as semiotic sign</b><br> 

A Theory of Semiotics by U. Eco is a spectacular work. It is the book that connects reflections of the previous work that goes back to 1967.  Eco’s activity is to study entire culture and to view into huge range of object and events as signs. One of his seeks is to observe the limits of future semiotic research and suggest a unified method for approaching dissimilar development. U. Eco’s major proposal covering his research is that semiotics studies all cultural processes as processes of communication. He defines semiotics as a discipline developing from “natural” phenomena to more “culturally” elaborated systems: zoo semiotics, olfactory signs, tactile communication, codes of taste, paralinguistics, medical semiotics, musical codes, formalized languages, written languages, unknown alphabets, secret codes, natural languages, visual communication, system of object, cultural codes, mass communication, and rhetoric.  
Eco states that every cultural entity becomes a semiotic sign. Sign cannot be understand by one ideal sign-producer. In this case social phenomena must be considered as elements subject to change and restructuring. He declares that a semiotic approach should be overseen by unspecified principle. In his semiotic approach to culture Eco rise questions as: what is a sign? What is the relation between signs and codes? How are signs produced, decoded and interpreted? 
Eco defines code, not as an element that organize signs, but as a code establishing rules, which generates signs. The codes become system of signification. In his opinion, is also important to include theory of how sign may be produced and interpreted. A theory of codes explains the “signification” and sign-production explains “communication”. Eco defines “signification’ as the semiotic event when a sign “stands for” something. And “ communication” is defined as a transmission of information from a source to a destination. Communication is based on existence of code, or by a system of signification. Code and system of signification define rules how the expression of signs interacts with their content. In a reason to build any form of communication we need to use a code or a system of signification. It gives us ability to correspond the expression and content of signs.  
U. Eco also mentions, in the theory of sign-production is necessary to next to a theory of communication implement a theory of “mentions” (i.e. referring acts) and a theory of communicational acts. In this case, communication clarifies the path of information transition from a source through a channel (expression) to a destination. While theory of “mention” explains how signs can be used in a process of naming things and defining actual situations. And the transition of verbal or non-verbal messages to the person would be analyzed by communicational acts.   
So how we can define a sign? According to Eco it is an abstract body, which is a cultural unit. Culture proposes to its members a chain of cultural units surrounding other cultural units, for culture constantly translates signs into other signs.  Eco claims following theories: 
1.  Meanings are culture 
2.  These units can be isolated to the group of their interpretants as revealed in a given culture 
3.  The study of the signs in a culture enables us to define the values of the inerpretants by viewing them in a system of positions and oppositions. 
4.  Sematic fields are useful tool for explaining significant oppositions. 
Every aspect of culture becomes a semantic unit – sign. Signs put together form a system. This system can be taken as a code to communicate. The communication process can be defined as process of culture. It works both ways. Communication is culture and culture is communication. We are the ones who forms codes, which establish rules and generates signs and define the cultural image. <br><br> 

<b>1.2. Signs and Symbols</b> <br>    
Our main communication forms is based by words. Written words you could arrange into collection of signs, which is letters of alphabet. We also expand our communication by using other sings. For example arrows in roads signs, which also helps us to navigate. In situation, then we do not use spoken language, signs becomes main form of communication. Good example would be using electronic tools. We tell them that to do through the signs that are understood by people who speak different languages.  
The main difference between signs and language is that signs and symbols do not have fixed grammar and syntax. Every object we see can be defined as a sign. If we will took on the most common object a chair, it has been described as a “sign for sitting’. To picture we could use installation by Joseph Kosuth’s installation ‘One and Three Chairs’ . Installation consists of: a chair is placed alongside a photograph of a chair and a dictionary definition of a word chair. It is possible to name all three objects as a chair, but they are presented in different code: a visual code, a verbal code and a code in the language of object.  The material or placing it in a form of art does not change it. It still gives the same meaning of sign – “sign for sitting”.  It comes from our own experience. We may also recognize the image that also represents other feelings, for example that we can touch or hear. But knowing that specific symbols perception is influenced by various places and images can have different meaning.   
We could picture that by taking simple sign – dot. The dot itself has no meaning. In written language is used to as indicator for end of a sentence. In other languages dot can be used as an accent of a vowel. In Morse code dot in combination with dashes forms an alternative alphabet. If we take out of the content dots and dashes, they remain marks without meaning.  If you would put dashes and dots together, our brains immediately will start combining them and putting into a form, which has a meaning, for example a face. We will “read” these signs as a face, a pictographic sign that represents a person. <br><br>    

<b>1.3. Alphabets and Alphabetic signs</b><br>  
Communication can be distinguished in two ways, with verbal or non-verbal signs. The non-verbal communication, in this case, written words, gives us ability to communicate in each other’s absence. Letters of the alphabet are most common signs in out transmission of message and together in a system become elements of writing. The use of words and letters are the main aspect, which separates human language from animal communication.  
Analyzing the origin of writing and the alphabet, we can get impression how the signs work. By analyzing the origin, we can classify them. Evolution of the alphabet specifies two kinds of sings. One of them is picture writing. It was based on making drawings and putting them in sequence. The images (pictograms) mean that they represent, and by organizing them into sequence they can make a story and communicate (send the message). Also pictograms can be used as a metaphor. For example, to represent “light” or “heat” or “day” we can use picture of a sun. In this case it becomes an ideogram. Ideogram stands for a picture, which has a meaning beyond its represented basic form.   In this case ideograms and pictograms becomes more symbols, rather than signs. But they can be implemented and used as a part of system of signs.  
Another kind of signs is alphabetic signs. The evolution of alphabetic signs rose from pictures. Alphabetic signs are meant to describe our spoken language. 
To represent all the possible syllables, the large number of signs was reduced to combinations of few consonants. In the tenth or eleventh century BCE, the North Semantic script of 22 characters emerged it was the origin of many alphabetic writings. Also including Arabic and Aramaic version, the source of Hebrew script. Greeks and Romans shaped the alphabet we have now. Greeks added vowels to it and Romans adapted it. 
It is possible to use in communications alphabetic signs and pictograms. Combinations of these two kinds of signs can also send as a message and makes it understandable to user. It can carry the same amount information, but in less characters. Our days communication, like never before is full of these example. Especially the common (basic) language is good example of that. Text message, comments in the Internet, social web pages are full of these examples. Besides using alphabetic signs and pictograms together, alphabetic signs also can become a “sign”. Good example is abbreviations. An abbreviation is shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually is shortened till three or four letters. In reason to understand that we need to learn it. At the moment we learn that and are able to recognize, it becomes for us a sign. Which is able to send a meaning by his shortened version.
