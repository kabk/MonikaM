<b> 3. Contemporary Language</b> <br><br>  

<b>3.1 Influence of Tomas Maldonado</b> 
<br> 
<br> 
Tomas Maldonado contribution was supreme in the evolution of analogical ways of computer thinking. (add introduction) <br>
Maldonado was born in Buenos Aires and studied at the art Academy of Fine Arts. He taught at the university of in Hochschule fur Gestaltung Ulm from 1955 – 1967 and became director of the school at 1964.Approach of HfG of Ulm – use computer science not as a tool for geometric design but as a tool for computer design. 
<br>   
The Hochschule fur Gestaltung Ulm, in Germany was found in 1953 and worked till 1968. School was operated during the period of the transitions from industrial society to post-industrial society. Belong to an era of Nazi and promoted the idea that in democratic society “good design” should be accessible to all.  
Observing the goals of mass production, HfG of Ulm school investigated also a scientific approach towards design. Main approach of HfG was to incorporate science and design, finding new possibilities to solve new problems of industrial culture. In the school appeared beginnings of operational view of design science. T. Maldonado called it a “scientific operacionalism”. The goal of the school was to fond a solid methodological basis for the work of design. As follows scientific knowledge and new methods were used in the search of design problems solutions within an industrialized environment. 
<br>   
Maldonado was a teacher of industrial design and visual communications (semiotics) with interest towards on philosophy of science and technology. At the moment he became the director of the University the curriculum was orientated into design for science. University of Ulm was oriented towards the theoretical part, but with strong shift to the technological design. Works related to productivity and functionality was more appreciated than stylistic ones.  With implementation of new subject to curriculum, Maldonado engaged students to engage in the scientific and theoretical philosophy of the time. 
The subject such as economics, sociology, operational research, linear programing techniques, cybernetic, were added into university curriculum. The most important integration was – semiotics. Integration of this subject into Europe university’s curriculum is due to his initiate.  Laszo Moholy Nagy, a Hungarian painter, photographer and director of the New Bauhaus did the beginning in USA.  He invited William Morris to introduce the principles of course “Intellectual Integration”. The course was combination of the theories of art, science and technology under his theory of signs. W.Morris assumed that all human activities can be analyzed as “a certain type of sign structure”. He was on of the bigger inspirations for T. Maldonado. Motivated by the Unified Movement Science, to which C.W.Morris belonged, Maldonado choose essential principles for a change in direction of HfG.

<b>3.2 Visual Metaphors</b> 
<br>  
<br> 
The increasing complexity of our communication with this world is influenced by complexity of the world. Usage of complex technological products, travelling and becoming more international, getting less personal help was a source for a new instruction systems. The large numbers of instructions were created to find our ways in complex surroundings. Now we use a big range of instructions, from interactive tutorials to tooltip, from safety instruction cards to wayfinding signage systems. Within all this fast development complexity in communications is just rising. Expanding complexity of the world implies expanding quantities of communication that implies complexity of the communication, so there is no predictions that it will get less in the near future. Despite complexity, language also becomes more metaphorical with importing technical phrases, color-coded drawings, and multimedia presentations into communication.  Metaphorical forms are applied in a reason to send a difficult message across. 
Another big influence on making language metaphorical is internationalization. We are developing more distance marketing that calls out increasing functions per device. In this case verbal language is not most efficient tool to communicate. As an effect, we see implementation of visuals like: schemas, pictograms, icons, and instructive pictures. These, visual tools, becomes part of visual instructive language to make it internationally understandable.  
<br> 
In reason to work visuals need to represent direct reality, but they are not. Every visual is an abstraction or interpretation of reality it depicts. In comparison with photo, pictograms, icons and other visualizations are just abstractions of the reality, because photo can be just a selection of reality. (more about VISUAL METAPHOR a metaphor describes one thing in terms of another. )
Despite, metaphors are abstractions of reality, they help us to navigate in the complexity that rises from using electronic devises. We are different from other animals because we use alphabetical signs, but also because we think metaphorically.  We think metaphorically and use metaphors to navigate in environment. Visuals metaphors surround us everywhere. We encounter them using our laptops, traveling by train. A visual metaphor becomes invisible communication between environment and us. We let to be guided by most of the visual metaphors because we are used to them. And at the moment, then we are lost we start looking for them to help us to find a way. That counts for every situation, or we are using a computer, or we are looking for our gates in airport. We all know that wastebasket icon on the computer screen indicates that we throw away a document from the computer hard disc by dragging the icon into the wastebasket. The numbers 1 and 2 in the train cabins indicates the value of the ticket. The round road sign with red stroke and number in the middle indicates the limit of our speed we are able to reach at that certain part of a rode. 
<br> 
Susan Kare made well-known example of user interface icons for computer. She is graphic designer and pioneer of pixel art, was a member of the Mac software design team. The famous icons as wastebasket and happy computer were made by here in 1980s.

<br>
The guides she got from Apple at the beginning was: “ Your Mom could use it” and “Like arcade games – no manuals”. The icons she was designing needed to be user friendly and understandable. So people would be able to use computer without looking into manual.
<br>   
Creating Macintosh (happy) icon she was inspired by ideas of S. McCloud written in the book “Understanding comics”. In his book he explains why and how a comic book becomes understandably to all. Then you make icon very realistic (in this case picture of face) with a lot of details people see another person, but then you make it cartoonish – people see themselves. 
<br>

<br>
You can see that the icons were well thought and described not just the machine it was used for but also helped to navigate. Design was not just based on a 32x32 pixels grid she was working on. It was a perfect combination of craft and metaphor. These icons are still used in our days with a small correction.
