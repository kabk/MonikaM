                <p>First, to talk about and be able to look at a piece of graphic element, we need to name some terms. This can be done by dividing visual communication into its components. There are three aspects of visual communication always present: 
1.  Social: Who made it and for whom? Why and when? 
2.  Technical: How was it made? What were the tools and materials used? What was the process? 
3.  Aesthetic: What was the cultural environment, including the current fashion or influence on style?  
Next to that can be listed functions of Graphic design: to inform, to identify, to present and promote (also to direct and demand). From these listed functions rises clear image of main goal of graphic design – communication. That follows that graphic design’s content subsists of messages. The messages are physical, consisting of alphabet and/or images. It is possible to declare that alphabet or images are ‘encoded’. The language is a unit to record language. One of the first we start learning in this world is alphabet. If we would not know the elements of the code, we would not able to transmit the message. The same process can be adjusted also to the images. Like an alphabet, images are also signs, which carry the meaning and refer viewers to their own experience of the real world.  
Signs, in a form of images or alphabet, surround us always. They can be seen in interfaces, books, poster etc. Also come out in a form of logo, pictogram and emblem. Totally in all form in witch we communicate. Still the main communication tool stays the written language. Just the dead language never changes. Languages, like cultures, influence each other. One of the main factors: migration, occupation, globalization and etc. We cannot deny, that Internet and New Media do the biggest influence to our language and behavior of communication. In other hand, society is also one of the biggest shapers of the language. The culture is formatted by society. And every culture entity becomes a semiotic sign. It becomes collection of symbols, which represents present times. 
With new media and technology language expands, there are new word made to name the things. The New Internet Language becomes a tool to navigate through all it. With new Internet language comes: autoreplies, new structure of communications, abbreviations etc. 
We used to write how we speak and now we speak how we type. The increasing amount of using acronyms, abbreviations give notion: if we are getting dumb or clever (having ability to manage two ways of communicating). Maybe we are getting back to our roots, and will start speaking in symbols / pictograms again?
