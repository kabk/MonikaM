The dead language never changes. Languages, like cultures, influence each other. The main reasons behind the language change are migration, occupation and globalization. We cannot deny that Internet and New Media have the biggest influence on our language and in communication behaviour. On the other hand, society is one of the biggest influences on the shape of our language. Therefore, the culture is formatted by society and every culture entity becomes a semiotic sign. It becomes the collection of symbols, which represent present times. Communication is the culture and culture is the communication: while we are changing, the code of communication is also changing. 
<br>
With new media and technology changes, language expands and new words are formed to name new inventions. What we are facing now is a time of complexity and information overload. In this huge amount of information we implement visual metaphors and signs to help us navigate and communicate. The implementation of signs and visual metaphors become a tool to navigate and make the new information understandable. The new Internet language comes with new structures of communication, abbreviations and visual metaphors. Moreover, new technologies also influence our way of writing. We used to write how we speak and now we speak the way we type. This ability is influenced by computers and smartphones, which give the ability to preserve communication in different places.  
<br>
Despite the changes in communication, the text remains the main communication form. Letters of the alphabet are the most common signs in the transmission of our messages. These alphabetic signs together in a system become the elements of writing. The visual form of the alphabet always changed within the periods it was used. The biggest changes in writing elements occurred before the Latin alphabet was formed. With the invention of the computer, new possibilities appeared in redesigning and redrawing typefaces. This process was emphasized by FUSE magazine. Each publication of the magazine became a research document showing new experiments to show flexibility of the alphabet structure.  Nowadays, we can see that our alphabetic code is changing in another way. It is becoming a language that is more visual and abstract. The combination of emoticons and abbreviation makes it a graphical and decoded language. It gives the notion that we will soon be using “LoCos” language invented by Yukio Ota (1939). This language, designed by Ota, was investigated as a possible visual language for texting in 2005.    
<br>
Nowadays, we are creating a new “figurative language” as a system of symbols to communicate. With a new symbol language we are able to express emotions, tell a story and give navigation to users. This information confirms that semiotic science is important to the design process, because that is what creates the patterns of communication. They build a link between all disciplines and interests in the problem of meaning and communication.
