 <b> \ Conclusion </b> <br><br>  

What we are facing now is a time of complexity and a big amount of information. Communication is changing: new ways of working and management are developed. In this huge amount of information we implement visual metaphors and signs to help us to navigate and communicate. Using signs and visual metaphors is an effective way to make information understandable. By linking abstract form to a concrete thought it help us to understand unfamiliar content. Therefore, visual metaphors create a sense of familiarity, attract attention and trigger emotions. Most important, visual metaphors can motivate user in action. This is especially important using Web and smart phones, because our big part of the communication is performed using new technologies.  
<br>
Theses changes also have impact to our basic communication. On an influence of the computer systems and communication media the new form of alphabet is formed. New technologies give us ability to communicate in another way. In a reason, we can communicate today the way we write (“type”). The text is a form of the communication, people being absent. Therefore, new technologies give as a possibility to communicate with each other at the same time, but being in different places.   
<br>
But technology is not the only aspect changing our communication. People using an alphabet as a main basic for the verbal and non-verbal communication have also influence on that. People form culture and every aspect of culture becomes a semantic unit – sign. A code to communicate can be taken as a system of signs. The communication process can be defined as a process of culture. Communication is the culture and culture is the communication. Therefore, we are the ones who form codes, which generate signs and define the cultural image. As we are changing also the code of communication is changing. The present language I call figurative language or dialectic alphabet. You can state that the language is becoming universal and without individual expression. But from the examples listed before, we can see that language by its graphical form can be expressive. New media gives as ability to design dialectic alphabets to small groups of people. From S.Kare example we can see that visual metaphors basic form can also be adapted to other programs with a little changes. The speech language is different for the written language, because it is less reflective. Implication of emoticons and signs by its graphical form gives ability to make it more reflective.  
<br>
To conclude, in this development of the communication we can see a rising need of semiotics. Especially is needed for design field people who are forming the communication. Designers are the ones who establish the link between all disciplines. They interest in the problem of meaning and communication. Also rising impact of programing code towards graphic design questions the new process of the future graphic design methods.
