<b> 1. Perception of culture and language according to semiotics</b> <br><br>  

<b>1.1 Culture as semiotic sign</b> 
<br> 
<br> 

A Theory of Semiotics by U. Eco is a spectacular work. It is the book that connects reflections of the previous work that goes back to 1967.  Eco’s activity is to study entire culture and to view into huge range of object and events as signs. One of his seeks is to observe the limits of future semiotic research and suggest a unified method for approaching dissimilar development. U. Eco’s major proposal covering his research is that semiotics studies all cultural processes as processes of communication. He defines semiotics as a discipline developing from “natural” phenomena to more “culturally” elaborated systems: zoo semiotics, olfactory signs, tactile communication, codes of taste, paralinguistics, medical semiotics, musical codes, formalized languages, written languages, unknown alphabets, secret codes, natural languages, visual communication, system of object, cultural codes, mass communication, and rhetoric.  
Eco states that every cultural entity becomes a semiotic sign. Sign cannot be understand by one ideal sign-producer. In this case social phenomena must be considered as elements subject to change and restructuring. He declares that a semiotic approach should be overseen by unspecified principle. In his semiotic approach to culture Eco rise questions as: what is a sign? What is the relation between signs and codes? How are signs produced, decoded and interpreted? 
Eco defines code, not as an element that organize signs, but as a code establishing rules, which generates signs. The codes become system of signification. In his opinion, is also important to include theory of how sign may be produced and interpreted. A theory of codes explains the “signification” and sign-production explains “communication”. Eco defines “signification’ as the semiotic event when a sign “stands for” something. And “ communication” is defined as a transmission of information from a source to a destination. Communication is based on existence of code, or by a system of signification. Code and system of signification define rules how the expression of signs interacts with their content. In a reason to build any form of communication we need to use a code or a system of signification. It gives us ability to correspond the expression and content of signs.  
U. Eco also mentions, in the theory of sign-production is necessary to next to a theory of communication implement a theory of “mentions” (i.e. referring acts) and a theory of communicational acts. In this case, communication clarifies the path of information transition from a source through a channel (expression) to a destination. While theory of “mention” explains how signs can be used in a process of naming things and defining actual situations. And the transition of verbal or non-verbal messages to the person would be analyzed by communicational acts.   
So how we can define a sign? According to Eco it is an abstract body, which is a cultural unit. Culture proposes to its members a chain of cultural units surrounding other cultural units, for culture constantly translates signs into other signs.  Eco claims following theories: 
1.  Meanings are culture 
2.  These units can be isolated to the group of their interpretants as revealed in a given culture 
3.  The study of the signs in a culture enables us to define the values of the inerpretants by viewing them in a system of positions and oppositions. 
4.  Sematic fields are useful tool for explaining significant oppositions. 
Every aspect of culture becomes a semantic unit – sign. Signs put together form a system. This system can be taken as a code to communicate. The communication process can be defined as process of culture. It works both ways. Communication is culture and culture is communication. We are the ones who forms codes, which establish rules and generates signs and define the cultural image. <br><br> 

<b>1.2. Signs and Symbols</b> 
<br> 
<br>    

Our main communication form is based by words. You could arrange written words into collection of signs, which is letters of alphabet. Despite alphabet we also expand our communication by using other sings. For example arrows in roads signs, which also helps us to navigate. In situation, then we do not use spoken language, signs becomes main form of communication. Good example would be using electronic tools. We tell them that to do through the signs. People who speak different languages are able to understand these signs.Also signs are the main object, which helps us to navigate in the city, roads, and airports. They show direction, define place, and regulate traffic. Good example of navigation sign is “T for the tram of Nice” by Pierre di Sciulio. The sculpture-letter defines a place for tram station and helps people to find the tramway. It appears different each time.

<br>

The main difference between signs and language is that signs and symbols do not have fixed grammar and syntax. Every object we see can be defined as a sign. If we will took on the most common object a chair, it has been described as a “sign for sitting’. To picture we could use installation by Joseph Kosuth’s installation ‘One and Three Chairs’ . Installation consists of: a chair is placed alongside a photograph of a chair and a dictionary definition of a word chair. It is possible to name all three objects as a chair, but they are presented in different code: a visual code, a verbal code and a code in the language of object.  The material or placing it in a form of art does not change it. It still gives the same meaning of sign – “sign for sitting”. The feeling comes from our own experience. We may also recognize the image that also represents other feelings, for example that we can touch or hear. But knowing that specific symbols perception is influenced by various places and images can have different meaning.  
<br>  
We could picture that by taking simple sign – dot. The dot itself has no meaning. In written language is used to as indicator for end of a sentence. In other languages dot can be used as an accent of a vowel. In Morse code dot in combination with dashes forms an alternative alphabet. The Morse Code was developed and used as an international telegraphic system which changed letters and numbers into dots and dashes. For FUZE magazine Rick Vermeulen created Morsig program. By making it as a digital typeface he shows its pure and basic form. The idea behind creating the alphabet was that “the alphabet is nothing more than a code” .Designers stylized over and over that basic code of the alphabet. In this case Morsig stands for the code that reduces action off communications to the essential message.

<div class="caption"> Morsig by Rick Vermeulen, FUSE 6, 1992</div> 

In my opinion, another interesting typeface created from dots is typeface Atomic Circle by Sylke Janetzky.

<div class="image"><img src="images/atomiccircle.jpeg" border="0"></div>
<br>
<div class="caption">Atomic Circle by Sylke Janetzky, FUSE 10, 189p. </div> 
   
The typeface is encoded just by using dots. It is easy to decode alphabet because the dots are always placed of the eyes in traditional capital letters. In this typeface lower- case is the same like the capitals, but the dots remain empty. By its form Atomic Circle reminds us braille alphabet used by the blind people. Braille is a tactile writing system traditionally embossed on a paper. Sylke Janetzky, inspired by atoms and braille, gives us a modern version of the typeface just by using dots. 
<br> 
If we take out of the content dots and dashes, they remain marks without meaning. And if you would put dashes and dots together, our brains immediately will start combining them and putting into a form, which has a meaning, for example a face. We will “read” these signs as a face, a pictographic sign that represents a person.  
<br>
We can play the same “game” with Moniteurs typeface MMMteurs-Cyber/MMMteurs-Real. In this case we form a letter putting characters together. The typeface is made just of equals signs, slashes, backslashes and semicircles. Designer already arranged characters to form a letter. But the view still need connect missing parts in head to see a letter. 

<div class="image"><img src="images/mmmteurs-cyber.png" border="0"></div>
<br>
<div class="caption"> Typeface by Moniteurs, MMMteurs-Cyber </div> 

MMMteurs-Cyber/MMMteurs-Real was created to show difference between the real world and cyberspace. Then you are in cyber space, you are very far from your text and you need to get used to another aesthetics. The Internet is the first stage of the cyberspace and “ASCII art” was chosen to express emotion of this medium. 

(How we read signs?)
<br><br>    

<b>1.3. Alphabets and Alphabetic signs</b> 
<br> 
<br>  

Communication can be distinguished in two ways, with verbal or non-verbal signs. The non-verbal communication, in this case, written words, gives us ability to communicate in each other’s absence. Letters of the alphabet are most common signs in transmission of the message and together in a system become elements of writing. The use of the words and letters are the main aspect, which separates human language from the animal communication.  
<br> 
Analyzing the origin of writing and the alphabet, we can get impression how the signs work. We can classify them by defining origin. Evolution of the alphabet specifies two kinds of sings: picture writings and alphabetic signs. Picture writing was based on making drawings and putting them in sequence. The images (pictograms) mean that they represent, and by organizing them into sequence they can make a story and communicate (send the message). Also pictograms can be used as a metaphor. For example, to represent “light” or “heat” or “day” we can use picture of a sun. In this case it becomes an ideogram. Ideogram stands for a picture, which has a meaning beyond its represented basic form.  In this case ideograms and pictograms becomes more symbols, rather than signs. But they can be implemented and used as a part of system of signs.    
<br>
Another kind of signs is alphabetic signs. The evolution of alphabetic signs rose from pictures and was meant to describe our spoken language. Phoenicians invented the first alphabet around 1250BC. It consisted of 22 consonants and was written from right to left.  To represent all the possible syllables, the large number of signs was reduced to combinations of few consonants. It became consonantal alphabet than means that while reading, a suitable vowel needed to be added to each consonant. By their merchant way of living, the Phoenicians spread the alphabet to Greece and other Mediterranean countries. In the homeland, Aramaic replaced the Phoenician language around the year 1 AD. The new language was influenced by Phoenician and had the 22 consonants in common. Phoenician and Aramaic language was a source for Semitic Hebrew. In 1984 it became the official language of Israel and is still written from right to left. Next ones who took over the “ baton” (alphabet) were Greeks. They used the Phoenician consonantal alphabet plus the Aramaic vowels. Greeks added more vowels and started writing form left to right. The alphabet became the alphabet of the western world through the Etruscans, and after them trough the Latins who conquered the Etruscans. 
<br>
Designers always created and improve typefaces according to communication tendencies and medium of present days. Looking through the timeline of typographical developments you can see how the Latin alphabet transformed. By clashing to different forms of alphabets you feel the loop of history and transformation. An interesting example of that could be typeface Linear Konstruct by Max Kisman. M. Kisman’s typeface was based on Roman alphabet and influenced by basic runic shapes. The capital letters are the same as the lower-case, but underlined and the numbers are overlined. Linear Konstruct was made at 1986, as screen font. The typeface was made as an example of “dialect” or “code” alphabet. Max Kisman imagined his typeface used by small-scale societies. Used as an internal communication, expressing the group identity. In his opinion, on an influence of computer systems and communications media the dialectic alphabets will become commonly used.

<br>
It is possible to use combination of alphabetic signs and pictograms in communications. Combinations of these two kinds of signs can also send as a message and makes it understandable to user. It can carry the same amount information, but in less characters. Our days communication, like never before is full of these example. Especially the common (basic) language is a proper example of that. Social web pages are full of these examples with text messages, comments in the Internet. The style we have now in our common language was strongly influenced by texting method. Emoticons and abbreviations help us to send a message faster and with less typing.   
<br>

<br>
Word can also become a “sign”. In my opinion a good example is abbreviations. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually is shortened till three or four letters. In reason to understand that we need to learn it. At the moment we learn it and are able to recognize, it becomes for us a sign, which sends us a meaning by his shortened version.    
<br>
Great example of using alphabet as a structure and form to express the visual language used at that moment is FUSE magazine. It was an experimental publication by Neville Brody and Jon Wozencroft on fonts and typography. It was launched in 1990, assembled in London and published by FontShop International and published till 2012. Each issue was packed in carton box with a disc with four or more fonts in it and five printed posters. Four designers were commissioned for each issue to explore theme related to various tendencies in communication. FUSE was meant to be a magazine for an exploration. The participants were invited to experiment with the visual language forms we use. Each publication of magazine became a research document showing new explorations. The basic of the FUSE was that a language is fluid.  Digital distribution systems allow us to circulate ideas that are changing in the visual form.
