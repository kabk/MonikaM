 <b> 1. Mass Media influence on communication</b> <br><br>  

Mass Media is reshaping and restructuring patterns of social communication and every aspect of our personal life. Everything is changing. As you are changing at the same time changes your relation to others and it works other way around. In these days, media shapes us more than never ever before. It becomes a new code/form of communication and involves all society. The visual metaphors become an unavoidable tool to navigate and use it. Learning to use technology you could compare to the learning an alphabet. Like children we absorb technology in an unconscious manner. It is a usual situation then child is a head ahead with abilities to use the computer and other media than his parents.  
<br>
The current situation today is well defined by M. McLuhan: “Come into my parlor”, said the computer to the specialist.  The wall between the virtual and real life is not anymore so visible. Media is becoming an extension of us. It is extension that forms how and that we see. Therefore, it structures the way we perceive the world. It forms our senses of the surrounded environment by creating a visual space.  
<br>
Mass Media spreads visual information by computer, television, newspapers and etc. In our days you could condense all these medias into one – computer. Now computer serves for the television, radio and newspapers. Computer and smartphone became more implemented in our communication. We communicate via computer, we work using computer and we share our life via computer. It is becoming our right hand, without which we do not imagine our life. New media gives us ability to know more about each other and follow the news of the world just by fast connection to the Internet. The fact that with computers help we can find a person very fast, shows that now we know too much about each other. Social networks influence us to be involved with each other. Using social networks we keep our old connections and increase our number of friends by people we met once or never in real life. We follow people in the Internet, and have discussions with them not being at the same room. Profile of social network and blogs becomes our “cloths”. We choose photos and add information we want to share with others. By these profiles we form other people perception towards us. The current situation can be defined as  “A global village” . In virtual reality we know a lot about each other, we are able to follow and see each other steps. We gather and want to be involved in social networks. We check news often because we have a fear of missing out.  We compete to be noticed and recognized. Internet and computer becomes connection to “real world” by all it means. Being online and up-to-date gives a feeling of being part of the society. 
<br>  
We believed that we heard and that other people told us. Before alphabet we spread information by narrating. Now we believe that is written or visualized. Confronted with visual information we feel more secure.  These translations of visuals form our perception and understanding of environment. We cannot control all information that we receive. Most of the times we are not able to choose that to look and see. Even trying to be still and not to observe, we will feel were we are with or against our will. Despite big amount information is also changing very fast. As soon as information is placed is replaced by new one. The same published information can be changed several times per day. Constant changes keep us to check information several times. These constant changes also affect the flow of the information. We are not able to build and read information serially because information and communications is always in interplay. Also the form where information is placed attracts people. Newspaper, blogs have bigger audience, because of their layout. They attract people by amount of information and visual graphics. The streams of condense information and graphic visuals satisfy the reader more than information in classic books layout. The similarities of newspaper layout can be seen in blogs and web sites.  
<br>
In this huge amount of information, implement of visual metaphors are very handy. Visual metaphors help us not just to navigate, but find the information that we are looking for. On the Web, our senses are more limited. Information needs to be placed the way, that user would think and feel the right thing. The effective way for making information understandable for user is metaphors. Metaphors create a sense of familiarity, attract attention and trigger emotions.
