 <b> 2. Perception of culture and language according to semiotics</b> <br><br>  

<b>2.1 Culture as a semiotic sign</b><br><br> 

Before talking about signs and alphabetic signs I would like to introduce Umberto Eco and his ideas about semiotics. U. Eco is an Italian semiotician, novelist, philosopher and literary critic.  He is best known for his historic mystery novel “The Name of the Rose”. This novel is an intellectual mystery combining semiotic in fictional, biblical analysis, medieval studies and literary theory.  He was very influential in developing approaches in the contemporary semiotics. A Theory of Semiotics by U. Eco is a spectacular work. It is the book that connects reflections of the previous work that goes back to 1967.  U. Eco’s activity is to study entire culture and to view into huge range of object and events as signs. One of his seeks is to observe the limits of the future semiotic research and suggest a unified method for approaching dissimilar development. U. Eco’s major proposal covering his research is that semiotics studies all cultural processes as processes of communication. He defines semiotics as a discipline developing from “natural” phenomena to more “culturally” elaborated systems: zoo semiotics, olfactory signs, tactile communication, codes of taste, paralinguistics (linguistic pictograms), medical semiotics, musical codes, formalized languages, written languages, unknown alphabets, secret codes, natural languages, visual communication, system of object, cultural codes, mass communication, and rhetoric.  
U. Eco states that every cultural entity becomes a semiotic sign. The sign cannot be understood by one ideal sign-producer. In this case social phenomena must be considered as the elements subject to change and restructuring. He declares that a semiotic approach should be overseen by unspecified principle. U. Eco brings up questions in his semiotic approach to culture as: what is a sign? What is the relation between signs and codes? How are signs produced, decoded and interpreted?  
<br>
U. Eco defines a code, not as an element that organizes signs, but as a code establishing rules, which generates signs. The codes become a system of signification. In his opinion, it is also important to include a theory of how the sign may be produced and interpreted. The theory of codes explains the “signification” and sign-production explains “communication”. U. Eco defines “signification’ as the semiotic event when a sign “stands for” something. And  “communication” is defined as a transmission of information from a source to a destination. Communication is based on existence of a code, or by a system of signification. The code and system of signification defines rules how the expression of signs interacts with their content. We need to use a code or a system of signification for a reason to build any form of communication. It gives us ability to correspond the expression and content of signs.  
U. Eco also mentions, in the theory of sign-production, it is necessary to implement a theory of communication next to a theory of “mentions” (i.e. referring acts) and a theory of communicational acts. In this case, communication clarifies the path of the information transition from a source through a channel (expression) to a destination. While theory of “mention” explains how signs can be used in a process of naming things and defining actual situations. The transition of verbal or non-verbal messages to the person would be analyzed by communicational acts.   
<br> 
So how we can define a sign? According to U. Eco it is an abstract body, which is a cultural unit. Culture proposes to its members a chain of cultural units surrounding other cultural units, for culture constantly translates signs into other signs. “U. Eco claims following theories: 
1.  Meanings are culture 
2.  These units can be isolated to the group of their interpreters as revealed in a given culture 
3.  The study of the signs in a culture enables us to define the values of the interpreters by viewing them in a system of positions and oppositions. 
4.  Semantic fields are useful tool for explaining significant oppositions. “ 
Every aspect of culture becomes a semantic unit – sign. Signs put together form a system. This system can be taken as a code to communicate. The communication process can be defined as a process of culture. It works both ways. Communication is the culture and culture is the communication. We are the ones who form codes, which establish rules and generate signs and define the cultural image. As we are changing also the code of communications is changing. The media we use and we are the main objects who influence the code of communication today. 
 <br><br> 

<b>2.2. Signs in communication</b> <br>    

Our main communication form is based on words. Written words could be arranged into a collection of signs - the letters of alphabet. We also expand our communication by using other signs. For example, the arrows in road signs also help us to follow and navigate. In the situation, then we do not use spoken language, signs become the main form of communication. A good example would be using the electronic tools. We tell them what to do through the signs that are understood by people who speak different languages. Also signs are the main object that helps us to navigate in the city, roads, and airports. They show direction, define place, and regulate traffic. Good example of navigation sign is “T for the tram of Nice” by Pierre di Sciulio. The sculpture-letter defines a place for the tram station and helps people to find the tramway. It appears different each time, because cutout forms are used to show the directions. In this case the letter T appears different each time. 
 

<div class="image"><img src="images/nice_04.jpg" border="0"></div>
<br>
<div class="caption"> T for the tram of Nice, by Pierre di Sciullo</div> 
The main difference between signs and language is that signs and symbols do not have fixed grammar and syntax. Every object we see can be defined as a sign. If we take as the most common object a chair, it will be described as a “sign for sitting’. An installation by Joseph Kosuth’s ‘One and Three Chairs’ , can be used to describe that. The installation consists of: a chair is placed alongside a photograph of a chair and a dictionary definition of a word chair. It is possible to name all three objects as a chair, but they are presented in different code: a visual code, a verbal code and a code in the language of object.  The material or placing it in a form of art does not change it. It still gives the same meaning of a sign – “sign for sitting”.  It comes from our own experience. We may also recognize the image that also represents other feelings, for example, that we can touch or hear. But knowing that the specific symbols’ perception is influenced by various places and images can have different meaning.    
<br>  
We could picture that by taking a simple sign – dot. The dot itself has no meaning. In written language it is used as indicator for the end of a sentence. In other languages dot can be used as an accent of a vowel. In Morse code dot in the combination with dashes forms an alternative alphabet. The Morse code was developed and used as an international telegraphic system, which changed letters and numbers into dots and dashes. For FUZE magazine Rick Vermeulen created Morsig program. By making it as a digital typeface he shows its pure and basic form. The idea behind creating the alphabet was that “the alphabet is nothing more than a code” . Designers stylized over and over that basic code of the alphabet. In this case Morsig stands for the code that reduces action off communications to the essential message.

<br>
<div class="caption"> Morsig by Rick Vermeulen, FUSE 6, 1992</div> 

In my opinion, another interesting typeface created from dots is typeface Atomic Circle by Sylke Janetzky. The typeface is encoded just by using dots. It is easy to decode alphabet because the dots are always placed of the eyes in traditional capital letters. In this typeface lower- case is the same like the capitals, but the dots remain empty. By its form Atomic Circle reminds us braille alphabet used by the blind people. Braille is a tactile writing system traditionally embossed on a paper. Sylke Janetzky, inspired by atoms and braille, gives us a modern version of the typeface just by using dots.

<br>

<br>
If we take out of the content dots and dashes, they remain marks without meaning.  If you put dashes and dots together, our brains immediately will start combining them and putting into a form, which has a meaning, for example a face. We will “read” these signs as a face, a pictographic sign that represents a person.  
<br> 
We can play the same “game” with Moniteurs typeface MMMteurs-Cyber/MMMteurs-Real. In this case we form a letter putting characters together. The typeface is made just of equals signs, slashes, backslashes and semicircles. Designer already arranged characters to form a letter. But the viewer still needs to connect missing parts in head to see a letter.


<div class="image"><img src="images/mmmteurs-cyber.png" border="0"></div>
<br>
<div class="caption"> Typeface by Moniteurs, MMMteurs-Cyber </div>  

MMMteurs-Cyber/MMMteurs-Real was created to show difference between the real world and cyberspace. Then you are in cyber space, you are very far from your text and you need to get used to another aesthetics. The Internet is the first stage of the cyberspace and “ASCII art” was chosen to express emotion of this medium.   
<br>
The given examples show how the alphabetic signs can be made from non-alphabetic signs. The separate signs can be combined into the alphabetic sign (letter). The new form constructed from several signs gives a graphical appearance. The formula, which forms graphical expression of letter and alphabet, is added to highlight the concept. To make alphabet readable the same formula needs to be adapted to designing letters. In this case, then alphabetic sign becomes a graphical representation of the letter, signs becomes readable just if they are placed together. Placing these signs separately, they can represent different things or fall out of the context. It proves, that our mind notice and “reads” the sign, how we used to recognize it. Seeing elements and separate sign we always look for a reason to connect them, that they would make sense. The alphabet is most unconsciously used sign system. It is a base for the verbal and non-verbal communication. 
<br><br>    

<b>2.3. Alphabetic signs as a visual language</b><br>  

Communication can be distinguished in two ways, with verbal or non-verbal signs. The non-verbal communication, in this case, the written words, give us the ability to communicate in each other’s absence. Letters of the alphabet are the most common signs in our transmission of message and together in a system become the elements of writing. The use of words and letters are the main aspect, which separates human language from the animal communication.  
Analyzing the origin of writing and the alphabet, we can get impression how the signs work. By analyzing the origin, we can classify them. Evolution of the alphabet specifies two kinds of sings. One of them is picture writing. It was based on making drawings and putting them in the sequence. The images (pictograms) mean what they represent, and by organizing them into the sequence they can make a story and communicate (send the message). Pictograms can also be used as a metaphor. For example, to represent “light” or “heat” or “day” we can use a picture of the sun. In this case, it becomes an ideogram. The ideogram stands for a picture, which has a meaning beyond its represented basic form. In this case ideograms and pictograms become more symbols, rather than signs. But they can be implemented and used as a part of a system of signs. 
<br>
Another kind of signs is alphabetic signs. The evolution of the alphabetic signs rose from the pictures and was meant to describe our spoken language. Phoenicians invented the first alphabet around 1250BC. It consisted of 22 consonants and was written from right to left.  To represent all the possible syllables, the large number of signs was reduced to combinations of few consonants. It became consonantal alphabet than means that while reading a suitable vowel needed to be added to each consonant. By their merchant way of living, the Phoenicians spread the alphabet to Greece and other Mediterranean countries. In the homeland, Aramaic replaced the Phoenician language around the year 1 AD. The new language was influenced by Phoenician and had the 22 consonants in common. Phoenician and Aramaic language was a source for Semitic Hebrew. In 1984 it became the official language of Israel and is still written from right to left. Next ones who took over the “ baton” (alphabet) were Greeks. They used the Phoenician consonantal alphabet plus the Aramaic vowels. Greeks added more vowels and started writing from the left to right. The alphabet became the alphabet of the western world through the Etruscans, and after them trough the Latins who conquered the Etruscans. 
<br>
Designers always created and improve the typefaces according to the communication tendencies and medium of the present days. Looking through the timeline of the typographical development you can see how the Latin alphabet transformed. By clashing to different forms of alphabets you can feel the loop of the history and transformation. An interesting example of that could be typeface Linear Konstruct by Max Kisman. M. Kisman’s typeface was based on the Roman alphabet and influenced by basic runic shapes. The capital letters are the same as the lower-case, but underlined and the numbers are overlined. Linear Konstruct was made at 1986, as screen font. The typeface was made as an example of “dialect” or “code” alphabet. Max Kisman imagined his typeface used by small-scale societies. Used as an internal communication, expressing the group identity. In his opinion, on an influence of computer systems and communications media the dialectic alphabets will become commonly used.

<br>
First, we used pictures as a form of communication, later followed an alphabet. It is possible to use in communications alphabetic signs and pictograms together. Combinations of these two kinds of signs can also be sent as a message. It can carry the same amount of information, but in less signs and still remains understandable. The communication of our days, like never before is full of those examples. Especially the common (basic) language is a good example of that. Text message, comments in the Internet, social web pages are full of those examples. The style we have now in our basic language was strongly influenced by the texting method. Emoticons and abbreviations help us to send a message faster and with less typing. In my opinion, this common trend of today seems to reflect the beginning of the alphabet. With emoticons we are able to express mostly the emotions. We use them in the end of sentence most of the time, or just send just a single emoticon. The variety of emoticons gives us ability to formulate even a story. With them we can express common emotion and that we do.  
<br>   


<div class="image"><img src="images/Emoticons.jpg" border="0"></div>
<br>
<div class="caption">Picture of Emoticons set for iPhone or iPad</div> 

<br>
Here I would like to mention Y.Ota’s invented language LoCos. LoCos is visible language created for people to provide a communication among people who do not share the spoken language. This language was even investigated as a possible visual language for phones. From example you can see that the language was universal and easy to use.     
<br>
This example shows that the new code for typing was questioned in a reason to create a universal language to everybody. In this LoCos language dot that used to indicate now, a dot followed by a dash to indicate the past and a dash followed by a dot to indicate future. The sign of a circle was used to indicate a man, with a dot inside it represented “me”.  That we see in this language, the signs give us possibility to transform whole sentence into the symbols. The basic symbols are chosen to indicate time, and secondary are used to name person, object and actions. If we are aware of signs, we can read the whole sentence and story.  
<br>
Great example of using alphabet as a structure and form to express the visual language used at that moment is FUSE magazine. It was an experimental publication by Neville Brody and Jon Wozencroft on fonts and typography. It was launched in 1990, assembled in London and published by FontShop International and published till 2012. Each issue was packed in carton box with a disc with four or more fonts in it and five printed posters. Four designers were commissioned for each issue to explore theme related to various tendencies in communication. FUSE was meant to be a magazine for an exploration. The participants were invited to experiment with the visual language forms we use. Each publication of magazine became a research document showing new explorations. The basic of the FUSE was that a language is fluid.  Digital distribution systems allow us to circulate ideas that are changing in the visual form.  
<br>
The FUSE example is exceptional in this content, because it was a graphical experiment to express the changes made by digital distribution. The magazine was not meant to develop a new language system for communication, but concentrated on visual experiments. In my opinion, this example is interesting, because it shows flexibility of the alphabet. The alphabet by his firm form becomes a canvas for experiments. These experiments shows, that the alphabet can be manipulated and implemented with other symbols. In this case the alphabet gains more expression. By his graphical form he can send more information for that it is used, or complement a story it is visualizing.  
Most of the typefaces in FUSE magazine are almost legible. The designs of the letters emphasize the concept behind. The forms of the alphabets are too complex and graphical to transfer a message to a wider audience. In this situation, small community could use these typefaces.  
<br>
The visual form of the alphabet always changed by the period it was used. The biggest changes happened till the Latin alphabet was formed. Before that alphabet and texts looked like symbols. After Latins formed constant letter shapes, the design was influenced by tool you write with. For example, Uncial script was written holding pen horizontally and making round forms. With computers came pixelated typefaces, it was influenced by grid of a screen. Now, with a help of computer we can, redesign and redraw all typefaces. In another way, we can see that our alphabetic code is changing in another way. It is becoming more visual and abstract language. The combination of emoticons and abbreviation makes it graphical and decoded language. 
<br><br>
<b>2.3. Abbreviations</b>
<br>

Besides using the alphabetic signs and pictograms together, the alphabetic signs can also become a “sign”.  Good examples are abbreviations. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually is shortened till three or four letters. There are two ways to do that: making abbreviation, then a shortened form of a word, used to represent the whole (for example, tmrw for tomorrow) and making acronym, then a word formed from the initial letters or groups of letters (for example, LOL for laughing out loud). To understand it we need to learn it. At the moment we learn it we are able to recognize it. An abbreviation becomes for us a sign that is being recognized to send a meaning by his shortened version. Typing tools, for example computer and mobile phones, influence appearance of the abbreviations we use now.<br>  
It is common opinion that the texting/typing is a curse. The idea is that texting fall out of the serious literacy or writing ability. The manner of texting is widely spread among young people. They are the ones, who started using that and spread it.  This phenomenon raises a lot of questions. Is our language getting a new form? Are we becoming illiterate?  
In order to answer that, we need to look back into the language foundations. Language has existed for perhaps 150, 000 years and it appeared as a speech. People used to spread the news by speech. Still that is how we use language most. Writing came along much later and manner of speaking changed along.  Today, we are not using metaphoric / poetic manners in our casual speech anymore. The casual speech is something quite different. Linguists claim that we are talking in a non-observing way, using a word collection of seven to ten words.  That makes the speech looser and telegraphic. Back in the day, we used to speak the way we write. And is logical that you might want also to write like you speak. In the past, materials were not able to provide it. Using the manual typewriter it was very difficult to maintain. In order to keep up the conversation you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly. Once you have the thing next to you, that can receive that message, then you have the circumstances that allows, that we can write like we speak. This is the situation where texting comes in. Texting is very loose in his structure, nobody thinks about capitals and punctuation. This is the same that we do while speaking. Texting gives us ability to write how we speak.  
<br>
With a new manner of writing (typing) a new kind of language and structure is coming up. For example, there is an abbreviation LOL is widely used.. We usually think of as meaning “laughing out loud”. And it does, and people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud. But now it is evolved into something, that is much more subtler. It became a marker of empathy and of accommodation. We have a whole collection of new constructions that are developing and implemented to texting. Texting is criticized by being an inelegant writing and incorrect. It will be always people who worry about these things, but that is happening today is a new way of writing developed by young people. They are using alongside their ordinary writing skills. That means that they are able to do two things.  
<br>  
We always used abbreviations, but by influence of texting it is becoming more widely used. The blended version now is used not just to represent a word, but express empathy and feelings. We use them as marks of the letters to describe our present emotion.  In my opinion, the abbreviations are becoming a visual marks/metaphors. By its short version of three – four letters, they are still able to send a message. We are able to understand it, if we are aware of that specific abbreviation. The message (meaning) stays the same, just the form changes. For example, WIFI – wireless Internet Free Internet; LDR – a long-distance relationship and other are implemented in Oxford Dictionary Online. That proves, that these abbreviations are becoming important part of our language.
