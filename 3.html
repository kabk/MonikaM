<b> 3. Signs in user interface </b> <br><br>  

<b>3.1 Influence of Tomas Maldonado</b> 
<br> 
<br> 
To understand the importance of semiotics to design and communication Tomas Maldonado needs to be introduced. T.Maldonado contribution was supreme in the evolution of analogical ways of computer thinking. Maldonado was born in Buenos Aires and studied at the art Academy of Fine Arts. He taught at the university of in Hochschule fur Gestaltung Ulm from 1955 – 1967 and became director of the university at 1964. Approach of HfG of Ulm – use computer science not as a tool for geometric design but as a tool for computer design. 
<br>   
The Hochschule fur Gestaltung Ulm, in Germany was found in 1953 and worked till 1968. University was operated during the period of the transitions from industrial society to post-industrial society. Belonged to an era of Nazi and promoted the idea that in democratic society “good design” should be accessible to all. 
<br>  
Observing the goals of mass production, HfG of Ulm University investigated also a scientific approach towards design. Main approach of HfG was to incorporate science and design, finding new possibilities to solve new problems of industrial culture. In the university appeared initiation of operational view towards design science. T. Maldonado called it a “scientific operacionalism”. The goal of the school was to find a solid methodological basis for the work of design. As followed scientific knowledge and new methods were used in the search of design problems solutions within an industrialized environment.  
<br>  
Maldonado was a teacher of industrial design and visual communications (semiotics) with interest towards on philosophy of science and technology. At the moment he became the director of the University the curriculum was orientated into the design for science. University of Ulm was oriented towards the theoretical part, but with strong shift to the technological design. Works related to productivity and functionality were more appreciated than stylistic ones. With implementation of new subject to curriculum, Maldonado engaged students to interest in the scientific and theoretical philosophy of the time. 
<br> 
The subjects such as economics, sociology, operational research, linear programing techniques, cybernetic, were added into university curriculum. The most important integration was – semiotics. Integration of this subject into Europe university’s curriculum is due to his initiate.  Laszo Moholy Nagy, a Hungarian painter, photographer and director of the New Bauhaus did the beginning in USA.  He invited C.W.Morris to introduce the principles of course “Intellectual Integration”. The course was combination of the theories of art, science and technology under his theory of signs. C.W.Morris assumed that all human activities could be analyzed as “a certain type of sign structure”. He was on of the bigger inspirations for T. Maldonado. Motivated by the Unified Movement Science, to which C.W.Morris belonged, Maldonado choose essential principles for a change in direction of HfG.  
<br>    
The main achievement of T.Maldonado was implementing semiotics in the curriculum. He became first professor of semiotics in the world. In his opinion semiotics was a tool that helps to understand, what was happening in the world of information and communication. The idea was to link the process of computerization of communication with the program, not only as management sign, but signs and symbols. Next to that he published the definitions of 94 terms “Terminology Semiotics”. These words meant to be an analytical tool for semiotic language for design. 
<br>  
The base of the new study program was writings of Ch. W. Morris. He can be regarded as a founder of modern semiotics and was one of the first to systematize semiotic philosophy. He declared that semiotics, the theory of signs, is needed to establish the link between all disciplines interested in the problem of meaning.  
<br> 
Despite theoretical works Maldonado also developed practical work. He and his colleague G. Bonsiepe, created the symbol system for electronic data processing machines, called Computer System ELEA 9003. Olivetti, the manufacturer of typewriters and computers, produced a computer System ELEA 9003. The task was to develop a new sign system for electronic data processing machines. Idea was that a new system includes combination of theory and practice. At first, developing a new system, as an alphabet was created as an inventory of signs.  This contained elements that could be combined to represent the various references. The alphabet consisted of two classes of signs: basic signs, comparable to the nouns, and determinatives, like adjective and verbs. The referents of the basic represented functional unit of a system, like disk memory. The referents of the determinatives stated the process executed by the machines, like “ready”, “compare”. A square was chosen as a base form for the basic signs, while a line for the determinatives.

<br>
This T.Maldonado and Bonsiepe symbols system shows a step between alphabet and user interface. The symbols system ELEA 9003 was based on parts of the speech. The symbols were very abstract and few forms still remained in the contemporary user interfaces. In my opinion it is a good example of speech transfer to navigation system. The graphical decisions were made by parts of speech. The units of the system were represented in square form and process referents in line form. These forms already give a notion of stable object and movement. It was a base for further user interface designs, even the signs were very abstract. 
<br> 
Another important achievement of T.Maldonado was semiotics implication to the University curriculum. In my opinion, the same step needs to be done also today. The rising impact of programing code towards graphic design questions the new curriculum of the future graphic design schools. The analog way of working becomes the rarity and exclusive. Graphic design becomes more influenced by generative design, web and app design. For this reason, form and function of graphic design are changing very quickly. By its form design becomes more interactive, user centered and dynamic. Therefore, interaction between person and graphic object becomes closer. Implication of semiotics is necessary in a process of designing, because it establish the link between all disciplines interested in the problem of interaction and navigation.
<br>
<br> 

<b>3.2 Visual metaphors in user navigation</b> 
<br>  
<br> 
The increasing complexity of our communication with this world is influenced by complexity of the world. Usage of complex technological products, travelling and becoming more international, getting less personal help was a source for a new instruction systems. The large numbers of instructions were created to find our ways in complex surroundings. Now we use a big range of instructions, from interactive tutorials to tooltip, from safety instruction cards to way finding signage systems. Within all this fast development complexity in communications is just rising. Expanding complexity of the world implies expanding quantities of communication that implies complexity of the communication, so there is no predictions that it will get less in the near future. Despite complexity, language also becomes more metaphorical with importing technical phrases, color-coded drawings, and multimedia presentations into communication.  Metaphorical forms are applied in a reason to send a difficult message across.  
<br>
Another big influence on making language metaphorical is internationalization. We are developing more distance marketing that calls out increasing functions per device. In this case verbal language is not most efficient tool to communicate. As an effect, we see implementation of visuals like: schemas, pictograms, icons, and instructive pictures. These, visual tools, becomes part of visual instructive language to make it internationally understandable.  
<br> 
In reason to work the visuals we need to represent direct reality, but visuals are straightforward representation of a reality. Every visual is an abstraction or interpretation of reality it depicts. In comparison with photo, pictograms, icons and other visualizations are just abstractions of the reality, because photo can be just a selection of reality.  
<br>
Despite, metaphors are abstractions of reality, they help us to navigate in the complexity that rises from using electronic devises. We are different from other animals because we use alphabetical signs, but also because we think metaphorically.  We think metaphorically and use metaphors to navigate in the environment. Visuals metaphors surround us everywhere. We encounter them using our laptops, traveling by train. A visual metaphor becomes invisible communication between environment and us. We let ourselves to be guided by most of the visual metaphors because we are used to them. And at the moment, then we are lost we start looking for them to help us to find a way. That counts for every situation, or we are using a computer, or we are looking for our gates in airport. We all know that wastebasket icon on the computer screen indicates that we throw away a document from the computer hard disc by dragging the icon into the wastebasket. The numbers 1 and 2 in the train cabins indicates the value of the ticket. The round road sign with red stroke and number in the middle indicates the limit of our speed we are able to reach at that certain part of a rode. 
<br> 
To explain the design of visual metaphors and how they need to be designed I need to introduce Susan Kare. She made well-known example of user interface icons for computer. She is a graphic designer and pioneer of pixel art, was a member of the Mac software design team. The famous icons as wastebasket and happy computer were made by here in 1980s. 
<br>

<div class="caption"> User interface icons for Mac software, Susan Kare, 1980.</div>  
<br>
The guides she got from Apple at the beginning was: “ Your Mom could use it” and “Like arcade games – no manuals”. The icons she was designing needed to be user friendly and understandable. So people would be able to use computer without looking into the manual.  
<br>  
Creating Macintosh (happy) icon she was inspired by ideas of S. McCloud written in the book “Understanding comics”. In his book he explains why and how a comic book becomes understandably to all. Then you make an icon very realistic (in this case picture of face) with a lot of details - people see another person, but then you make it cartoonish – people see themselves. 

<br>

<div class="caption">Macintosh (happy) icon Susan Kare, 1980. </div>  
<br>
You can see that the icons were well thought and described not just the machine it was used for but also helped to navigate. Design was not just based on a 32x32 pixels grid she was working on. It was a perfect combination of craft and metaphor. These icons are still used in our days with a small correction. And that in simplicity hides the purpose of navigation. Therefore, icon needs to be symbolic, clear and cartoonish. It should not mislead user by its graphical form.  
<br>
To conclude, visual metaphors can benefit user experience in a lot of way. Visual metaphors helps user to understand the information. By linking abstract form to a concrete thought, is the easiest way to understand unfamiliar content.  For example Web metaphors, icons, refer to something we know in the physical world and help us grasp the idea quickly. Also metaphors in the websites can help to draw attention of user with general of very specific elements within a web page. The reason why metaphors are so effective is familiarity. Metaphors help us to recognize things, by creating familiarities. If we are not able to recognize it, our brain tries to make a sense of the object. For this reason we use patterns to understand and to get idea of what to expect. By recognizing mental patterns we are able to understand the unfamiliar. In consequence, metaphors trigger our emotions and make our design appealing to people. Most important, visual metaphors can motivate user in action. Using interaction in the Web we know in real world user can become more engaging and actionable. In this way, metaphors help as to act intuitively.
